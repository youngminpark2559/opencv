# How to express digital image
# =======================================================================

# Digital image is sort of matrix (2d array)

# =======================================================================
# How to access to pixel (2 ways)
# =======================================================================

# 1. You can use image xy coordinates (x,y)
# Going right, value increases
# Going down, value increases

# 1. You can use matrix location by row and column (r,c)
# Going right, value increases
# Going down, value increases

# =======================================================================
# types of digital image
# =======================================================================

# When you use dots onto 2d array to express image, 
# this is called bitmap image or raster image

# The opposite concept with bitmap image is vector image

# Bitmap font uses dot to create font
# Vector font uses formular to create font

# =======================================================================
# approximate image
# =======================================================================

# You can use function to simply express image instead xy coordinates and matrix
# I(x,y)
# x,y : spatial coordinates
# I : intensity (gray level)
