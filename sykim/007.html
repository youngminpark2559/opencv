thresholding : 
1. select criterion value T
1. if bright level of each pixel of input image is less than T, that pixel becomes 0 (darkest)

then you can get binary image : flat white, flat black

=========================================================
Binarization is much used for segmentation of object from background

color apple image is converted into gray-scale image

</xmp><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/youngmtool/opencv/master/sykim/pic/2018-06-10 17-03-29.png"><xmp>


then, you will convert gray-scale apple image into binary image
When doing this, most important is setting thresholding value

this is histogram of above gray-scale apple image

case where you chose thresholding value from left area (at 110)
part of object (apple) is not included

part of background is included

=========================================================
how to choose thresholding value

thresholding is good way of separating image when histogram shows bimodal histogram (two peeks) which is case with one object + background

=========================================================
object doesn't have high peek
background has high peek (dark)

It turned out 26 is almost optimal

=========================================================
It's good way to make process of finding optimal thresholding value automatic

You can use otsu algorithm which was suggested in 1976

Mechanism
1. When you divide entire histogram into 2 groups, 
each group should have consistent brightness distribution, 
2 groups should have maximal difference in brightness
1. You find score Ts for all possible ways
then, you use best thresholding value
Search ways : exhausive search, hill climbing
1. In optimization algorithm, you use cost function (or objective function) when finding store Ts

% =========================================================
target (objective) function

variance shows how much it has changes, how values are spread 
you can use variance for target function

good separation -> small changes inside of object : low variance

$$$T_{opt}=arg_{1\leq k \leq L-1}min(\sigma_{W}^{2}(k))$$$
k changes from 1 to L-1
L : maximum brightness which image can have
lowest variance with $$$\sigma_{W}^{2}(k)$$$, and you find argument k at that moment
then, you will use that k as thresholding value

$$$\sigma_{W}^{2}(k) = \omega_{1}(k)\sigma_{1}^{2}(k)+\omega_{2}(k)\sigma_{2}^{2}(k)$$$
$$$\sigma_{1}^{2}$$$ : variance of first group 
$$$\sigma_{2}^{2}$$$ : variance of second group 
$$$\omega_{1}$$$ : probability of occuring first group, weight, some group can be larger than other groups (which has high probability of occuring)
$$$\omega_{2}$$$ : probability of occuring second group, weight

% =========================================================
First : when you're given input image, calculate histogram

Second : You find average value to separate class on $$$T=k(k\geq 1)$$$

suppose you have one thresholding value k,
$$$C_{1}(k) = \sum\limits_{i=0}^{k-1}N_{i}$$$
$$$C_{1}(k)$$$ : entire number of pixel involved in groups less than k
$$$i$$$ : brightness
$$$N_{0}$$$ : number of pixels which has 0 in brightness

$$$C_{2}(k) = \sum\limits_{i=0}^{k-1}N_{i} = N-C_{1}(k)$$$
$$$C_{2}(k)$$$ : entire number of pixel involved in groups between k to L-l
$$$i$$$ : brightness
$$$N_{0}$$$ : number of pixels which has 0 in brightness

$$$\omega_{1}(k) = \frac{C_{1}(k)}{N}$$$
$$$\omega_{2}(k) = \frac{C_{2}(k)}{N} = 1-\omega_{1}(k)$$$

ingredients for averages
$$$\mu_{T1}(k)=\sum\limits_{i=0}^{k-1}i\cdot N_{i}$$$
$$$\mu_{T2}(k)=\sum\limits_{i=k}^{L-1}i\cdot N_{i}$$$
$$$\mu_{T}(k)=\sum\limits_{i=0}^{L-1}i\cdot N_{i}$$$
$$$\mu_{T}$$$ : average of entire

averages
$$$\mu_{1}(k)= \frac{\mu_{T1}(k)}{C_{1}(k)}$$$
$$$\mu_{2}(k)= \frac{\mu_{T2}(k)}{C_{2}(k)}=\frac{\mu_{T}-\mu_{T1}(k)}{N-C_{1}(k)}$$$
$$$\mu_{1}$$$ : average of group1
$$$\mu_{2}$$$ : average of group2

Why you find average? To find variance

Third, you find variance $$$\sigma_{W}^{2}$$$ to separate class on $$$T=k(k\geq 1)$$$
$$$\sigma_{1}^{2}(k)=\sum\limits_{n=0}^{k-1}[n-\mu_{1}(k)]^{2}\frac{N_{n}}{C_{1}(k)}$$$
$$$\sigma_{2}^{2}(k)=\sum\limits_{n=k}^{L-1}[n-\mu_{2}(k)]^{2}\frac{N_{n}}{C_{2}(k)}$$$

$$$\sigma_{1}^{2}(k)$$$ : variance of first group
$$$\sigma_{2}^{2}(k)$$$ : variance of second group

target function :
$$$\sigma_{W}^{2}(k) = \omega_{1}(k)\sigma_{1}^{2}(k) + \omega_{2}(k)\sigma_{2}^{2}(k)$$$

4th : select optimal thresholding value by iterating in respect to all levels
$$$T_{opt} = arg_{1\leq k \leq L-1}min(\sigma_{W}^{2}(k))$$$

% =========================================================
above method takes much time

let's find other method
variance can be decomposed into varianceB and varianceW
$$$\sigma^{2}=\sigma_{B}^{2}+\sigma_{W}^{2}$$$

within class variance :
$$$\sigma_{W}^{2} = \omega_{1}\sigma_{1}^{2}+\omega_{2}\sigma_{2}^{2}$$$

between class variance : (this reduces time)
$$$\sigma_{B}^{2} = \sigma^{2} - \sigma_{W}^{2}$$$
$$$=\omega_{1}(\mu_{1}-\mu)^{2}+\omega_{2}(\mu_{2}-\mu)^{2}$$$
$$$=\omega_{1}\omega_{2}(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2})^{2}$$$
$$$=\omega_{1}(1-\omega_{2})(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2})^{2}$$$

You can use predefined values to reduce time
if k=0,
$$$\omega_{1}(0)=N_{0}$$$
$$$N_{0}$$$ : number of pixels which have brightness 0
$$$\mu_{1}(0)=0$$$

if k>1,
$$$\omega_{1}(k)=\omega_{1}(k-1)+N_{k}$$$
$$$\mu_{1}(k)=\frac{\omega_{1}(k-1)\mu_{2}(k-1)+kN_{k}}{\omega_{1}(k)}$$$
$$$\mu_{2}(k)=\frac{\mu-\omega_{1}(k)\mu_{1}(k)}{1-\omega_{1}(k)}$$$

% =========================================================
summary algorithm

1. find histogram of input image
1. find $$$\omega_{1}(0), \mu_{1}(0)$$$
1. in respect to each thresholding value k $$$(1\leq k \leq L)$$$,
    1. find $$$\omega_{0}(k), \mu_{1}(k), \mu_{2}(k)$$$
    1. find $$$\sigma_{B}^{2}(k)$$$
    1. if current $$$\sigma_{B}^{2}(k)$$$ is greater than current maximum $$$\sigma_{B}^{2}$$$
        1. you update current $$$\sigma_{B}^{2}(k)$$$ to current maximum $$$\sigma_{B}^{2}$$$
        1. you choose threshold k as optimal threshold $$$T_{opt}$$$
