=========================================================
clustring technique performs image segmentation by using clustring in feature space
image segmentation via clustring is not general method

general method is region-based image segmentation

=========================================================
Process

1. You perform mapping each pixel of input image into feature space
1. In feature space, by using similarity, you separate each pixel into corresponding cluter
1. You perform inverse mapping to get input image

=========================================================
Feature space 

general feature space is color space which is composed of basic color (RGB)

3-D feature space : each axis is RGB

</xmp><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/youngmtool/opencv/master/sykim/pic/2018-06-10 16-12-12.png"><xmp>


In 3-D feature space, one pixel is expressed as one point
Value of one point = (20,100,12)

red region, green region

=========================================================
clustring technique for image segmentation on gray-scale image

color feature space is 3-D
gray-scale feature space is 1-D

This way creates inconsistent edges

This way creates rather consistent edges

=========================================================
image segmentation with recursive thresholding technique

thresholding is performed based on histogram which also can be considered as feature space

histogram expresses distribution of brightness of image

thresholding is fitted to bimodal image (one object + background)
recursive thresholding technique is upgraded version from thresholding technique 

=========================================================
image segmentation with recursive thresholding technique

process 

1. find histogram
1. find optimal threshold value which will separate 1 bin into 2 bins
you can use otsu method for this
1. iterates 2nd step on each region until you obtain regions as much as you want 

=========================================================
input image, banana and apple

its histogram
threshold value 128 is found by otsu method

</xmp><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/youngmtool/opencv/master/sykim/pic/2018-06-10 16-26-08.png"><xmp>


result with 128

You can set 3 as number of regions (background, banana, apple)
You iterate above way

Second threshold value is 216

how to perform "labeling connected component"

You consider connected pixels as one unit, then, you give it label, then, you make it one object

There are many methods

Let's see general method

general "labeling connected component" is applied to binary image, which uses 4-connectivity

Process
1. You scan entire image, from left to right, from top to bottom
1. If you run into pixel which doesn't have 0 value (object pixel), you will see its up and left pixels
    both 0 case : you give new label to above pixel as new object
    either 0 case : you give label which 1 pixel has to this pixel
    both 1 case :
        both same label : pass
        different labels : you set them as "equivalence"
1. You iterate 2nd step for all pixels
1. For "equivalence" label, you reconfigure label

=========================================================
summary

image segmentation is process of separating entire image into objects

image segmentation techniques
1. region-based segmentation
1. clustring-based segmentation
1. boundary detection-based segmentation

To perform segmentation, you consider:
noise about removal
connectivity (4,8,6)
